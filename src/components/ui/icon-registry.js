 * Icons named by the content model.
 *
 * `categories.icon_name`, `feature_items.icon_name` and `process_steps.icon_name`
 * hold Lucide names chosen by an editor, so the set is data rather than code.
 * This registry is explicit instead of a wildcard import: `import * as lucide`
 * would pull all 6,299 icons into the bundle and defeat tree-shaking.
 *
 * Add an entry when the content team starts using a new name.
